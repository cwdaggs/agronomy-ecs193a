Too often, the research that comes out of the isn't relevant or is dangerously inaccurate.  Most of the students doing the research today don't have the background to understand the context of the research.

That being said I have some ideas for research that needs to be done.

There is some really interesting work being done in Australia and New Zealand on using grazing in a crop rotation that could be adapted to our conditions in California.

I would like to see if cover crops with nematocidal properties can increase the productive lifespans of orchards.

With the need to conserve water and protect against flooding. I would like to see research looking at deep ripping foothill grazing lands to improve percolation during storm events and long term increase the organic matter in the soil.

I would like a better understanding of soil quality as it relates to suitability for cropping.  Out in my area, a lot of marginal land and habitat has been converted to orchards because the increased costs and lower yield potential were not appreciated. 

Lastly, I would like to see research on soil amendments for improving biomass production on pasture.",26- 34 years,Male,White or Caucasian,Yes,"Corn Silage, Small Grain Silage, Grass and Grass Mixtures Pasture"
