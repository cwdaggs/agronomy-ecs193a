Senior design project Winter-Spring 2022

Team Development Standard:
Workflow: Team members will use the following process to develop a feature or bug fix.

Create a branch using the following naming convention: ‐<name‐of‐feature> e.g. nd‐dev‐standards
When you are ready for feedback on your changes, even if they are not ready to be fully reviewed, open a pull request.
When your changes are ready for review, strive to resolve merge conflicts with the master branch before asking for review.
Pull requests require at least TWO other teammates to review and sign off via GitHub pull request approval. Code review responsibilities should be divided among all teammates.
The pull request creator will make any reasonable changes requested by reviewers until the pull request is approved.
The pull request creator will ship the feature into master with a squash commit via GitHub. Commit messages should, at a minimum, contain a concise but descriptive explanation of the changes.
Style: Will be determined by the languages chosen for the project (after discussing with the client)
