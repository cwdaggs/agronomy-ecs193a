                Cooperative Extension (CE) is a nationwide network of land-grant university researchers and educators who solve problems 
                in agriculture, the environment, and human and community well-being. They work to foster a connection between the university 
                and the public by delivering science-based information. However, UC Cooperative Extension is facing reductions in personnel, 
                meaning current advisors are stretched thin and need to prioritize their efforts. At the same time, the landscape of 
                California agriculture is rapidly changing and farmers are encountering new challenges such as regulations on labor and 
                inputs. We recently conducted a statewide collaborative needs assessment to give a voice to farmers and others in agriculture
                to understand their priorities and inform future UCCE programs, increasing engagement and impact. Specifically, we
                administered an online survey to shed light on common challenges and top concerns of growers, consultants, and allied
                industry for agronomic crops across the state. Now, our team hopes to disseminate the findings to the general public
                through an interactive website. This resource will also be critical for state regulatory agencies and policy-makers
                to identify new opportunities for research, extension, and collaboration.
