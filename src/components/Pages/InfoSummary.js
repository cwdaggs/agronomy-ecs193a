                Cameron joined the Department of Plant Sciences in 2019. He is an agronomist who places equal emphasis on food security and 
                environmental sustainability. His research is focused on developing cropping systems and management strategies to enhance 
                productivity while minimizing nitrogen, carbon, water, and energy footprints in agriculture. Cameron was Assistant Professor 
                at the University of Illinois from 2014-2019 before moving to UC Davis. He maintains Adjunct status there while finishing 
                projects and advising graduate students until completion of their degrees. He received his BA in Environmental Biology from 
                Colgate University, and his MS and PhD degrees from UC Davis in International Agricultural Development and Agronomy, 
                respectively.
